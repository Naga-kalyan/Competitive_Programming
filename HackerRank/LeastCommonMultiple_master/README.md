# LeastCommonMultiple
# DESCRIPTION
The LCM of two numbers is defined as the least number which is completely divisible (dividing the LCM by either of the numbers leaves no remainder) by both the numbers. You have to define a function **LCM()** which takes two integers as its parameters and prints their LCM.

#### Input
* The first line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases **T**.
* The next **T** lines contain two space-separated integers **n1** and **n2**.

### Constraints
* 1 <= n1 <= 1000
* 1 <= n2 <= 1000
* n1 <= n2

#### Output
* For each test case, print the LCM of **n1** and **n2**.
* If **n1** and **n2** is not within the desired range, print "**Out of Range!**"
