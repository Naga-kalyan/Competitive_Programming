# BasicCalculator
# DESCRIPTION
Alan has been assigned a project to design a calculator which can perform simple calculations on only two operands, for these operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Remainder

The user takes the input as two operands and one operator. Based on the operator used, the program should result in the desired output.

#### Input
* The first line contains the number of test cases T
* The second line contains two space separated integer operand values.
* The next T lines contain a single character operator for these operations:
  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (*)
  * Division (/)
  * Remainder (%)
#### Output
* For each test case, print the resultant value of the operation. All resultant values should be **integers**.
