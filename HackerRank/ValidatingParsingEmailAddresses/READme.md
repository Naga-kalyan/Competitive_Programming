# Validating and Parsing Email Addresses
A valid email address meets the following criteria:
* It's composed of a username, domain name, and extension assembled in this format: username@domain.extension
* The username starts with an English alphabetical character, and any subsequent characters consist of one or more of the following: alphanumeric characters, -,., and _.
* The domain and extension contain only English alphabetical characters.
* The extension is **1, 2, or 3** characters in length.
<br>Given **n** pairs of names and email addresses as input, print each name and email address pair having a valid email address on a new line.

**Hint:** Try using Email.utils() to complete this challenge. For example, this code:
```
import email.utils
print email.utils.parseaddr('DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>')
print email.utils.formataddr(('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com'))
```
produces this output:
```
('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com')
DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>
```
### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, **n**, denoting the number of email address.
<br>Each line **i** of the **n** subsequent lines contains a name and an email address as two space-separated values following this format:
```
name <user@email.com>
```
### Constraints
* **0 < n < 100**
#### Output Format
Print the space-separated name and email address pairs containing valid email addresses only. Each pair must be printed on a new line in the following format:
```
name <user@email.com>
```
You must print each valid email address in the same order as it was received as input.
### Sample Input
```
2  
DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>
VIRUS <virus!@variable.:p>
```
### Sample Output
```
DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>
```
## Explanation

dexter@hotmail.com is a valid email address, so we print the name and email address pair received as input on a new line.
<br>virus!@variable.:p is not a valid email address because the username contains an exclamation point (!) and the extension contains a colon (:). As this email is not valid, we print nothing.
