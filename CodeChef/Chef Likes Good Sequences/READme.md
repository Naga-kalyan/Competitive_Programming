# Chef Likes Good Sequences
Chef calls a sequence good if it does not contain any two adjacent identical elements.

Initially, Chef has a sequence a1,a2,…,aN. He likes to change the sequence every now and then. You should process Q queries. In each query, Chef chooses an index x and changes the x-th element of the sequence to y. After each query, can you find the length of the longest good subsequence of the current sequence?

Note that the queries are not independent.

#### Input
* The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
* The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
* The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
* Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.

#### Output
* After each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the length of the longest good subsequence.

### Constraints
* 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
* 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each valid i
* 1 ≤ x ≤ N
* 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9
