# MultiplicationTable
DESCRIPTION
You have to help Daniel print the multiplication tables of as many numbers as he likes. Given an integer **N**, print the first 10 multiples. The output format should be of the form:
**N x i = result** , where 1 <= i <= 10

#### Input

* The number of test cases **T**.
* The next **T** lines will contain a single integer **N**, for which the multiplication table is to be printed.

### Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 50
* 2 <= N <= 100
* 1 <= i <= 10

#### Output

* For each value of **N**, 10 lines of multiplication table shall be printed in the form:  **N x i = result**
* Each multiplication table is to be end with 15 equal (=) signs below it,
