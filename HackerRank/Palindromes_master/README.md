# Palindromes
# DESCRIPTION
A string is called a palindrome if it is the same if read backwards as it is when read forwards (case-insensitive). You have to write a piece of code which checks whether a string is palindrome or not. If yes, print "String is a PALINDROME", else print "String NOT a PALINDROME".

#### Input
* The first line contains a string, which is to be checked whether it is a palindrome or not.

#### Output
* For the given string, check whether it is a Palindrome or not. If yes, print "String is a PALINDROME", else print "String NOT a PALINDROME".

### Constraints
* The string should be a single word, i.e. no spaces in between.
* If the given constraint is not followed, the code should print "String NOT a PALINDROME".
