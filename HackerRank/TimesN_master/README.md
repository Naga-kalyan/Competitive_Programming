# Times-N
# DESCRIPTION
Write a program that takes an integer **N**  and a character **C** and prints a string, **N** characters long, consisting only of **C**'s.
For example,if **N = 5** and and **C = 'x'** should return the string **"xxxxx"** (without quotes).

(Python is unusual in that you can actually write an expression 5 * "x" that will evaluate to "xxxxx". For the sake of the exercise you should ignore that the problem can be solved in this manner.)

#### Input Format:
* First line will contain an integer, **N**, and second line will contain a string

#### Output Format:
* print char **C, N** times

## Sample test case:

#### input #1:
```
5
x
```
#### Output #1:
```
xxxxx
```
### Explanation:
First line contains an integer 5 and second line has character x. Hence the output is  xxxxx
