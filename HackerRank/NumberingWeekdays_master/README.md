# Numbering-weekdays
# DESCRIPTION
Ram is your boss and wants you to know their convention of numbering the weekdays. He, therefore, asks you to tell the day of the week that corresponds to a given number. He gives you the company rule book that says that Monday will be day number zero(0), the next day will be day 1 and so on.
He is persistent on teaching you the day numbering and hence you need to focus only on that.

Write a function, which takes in an integer and returns the corresponding day of the week.

#### Input
* The first line with a number of test cases T.
* T lines follow containing one number N.

#### Output
* For each test case, print the corresponding day of the week (all lowercase).

### Constraints
* 1 <= T <= 7
* 0 <= N < 7

## Sample Test Case

#### Input
```

```
#### Output
```
tuesdaye week.
